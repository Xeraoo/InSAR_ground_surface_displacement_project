# Satellite Differential Interferometry (InSAR) in Monitoring Terrain Surface Displacements

## Project Description
This project utilized Sentinel-1 satellite data and advanced ESA SNAP software to analyze terrain surface displacements. We focused on the differential interferometry (InSAR) method, examining changes between radar images and the impact of topography and atmosphere on the results obtained. This project involves a detailed data processing workflow, from acquiring SAR images to co-registration, phase filtering, and result analysis in QGIS.

### Main Data Processing Steps:
- Acquisition and preliminary processing of Sentinel-1 imagery
- Co-registration of images
- Generation of interferograms and coherence estimation
- Phase filtering and interferometric phase unwrapping
- Conversion of phase values to terrain displacements
- Analysis of surface displacements in QGIS

## Introduction
The objective of this project was to analyze terrain surface displacements using Sentinel-1 satellite data and ESA SNAP software. Differential interferometry allows for precise assessment of surface changes based on radar signal phase analysis. By employing two imaging geometries: LOS (Line of Sight) and vertical displacements, the project provided detailed insights into the changes occurring in the studied area.

## Conclusions
The analysis of terrain surface displacements, both in the LOS geometry and for vertical displacements, confirmed the high accuracy of the differential interferometry method. Areas with higher coherence of the radar signal correlate with smaller displacements, while areas with lower coherence indicate greater changes in the terrain.
